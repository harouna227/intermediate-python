Process: An advantage of a program(e.g a Python interpreter)

+ Takes advantage of multiple CPUs and cores
+ Separate memory space -> Memory is not shared between processes
+ Great for CPU_bound processing
+ New process is stated independently from other processes
+ Processes are interruptable/killable
+ One GIL for each process -> avoids GIL limitation

- Heavyweight
- Starting a process is slower than starting a thread.
- More memory
- IPC (inter-process communication) is more complicated
